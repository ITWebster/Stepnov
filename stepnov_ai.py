thoughts_motives = "'. . . I need to keep regular hours, I could not function even passably where properly chilled beer was not continually available, and I cannot run fast. If I am forced to engage in extreme physical effort, such as killing a snake, I am hungry for days.':'Wolfe explains why he is useful for a select few number of cases; usually Cramer is much more effective.','I love to make a mistake, it is my only assurance that I cannot reasonably be expected to assume the burden of omniscience.':'Wolfe explains to Archie why he takes making mistakes so well.','If you regard it as a rational project to try to find a legitimate nocturnal pick washer, go ahead.':'Wolfe giving his perspective to D.A. Waddell concerning evidence surrounding the death of Clyde Osgood. Waddell is grasping for a reason for a pickax handle to be wet at 11 pm.','I would rather become a policeman and take orders from Mr. Cramer than work for anything or anyone called Sweeties.':'Nero explaining his decision not to allow Sweeties to pay part of his fee to find the killer of Cyril Orchard.','Since I entered this room you have made nothing but mistakes. You were without courtesy, which was offensive. You made a statement contrary to fact, which was stupid. You confused conjecture with knowledge, which was disingenuous.':'Wolfe giving a free but valuable lesson to homicide cop O'Grady after he tries to push Wolfe around (this was the first time they'd met).','Accept my apologies, Mr. Townsend. I once saw golf clubs through a shop window while my car was having a flat tire, but the ends were not labeled.':'Wolfe explaining to a sporting good salesman (Townsend) why he does not know that the end of a golf club is called the head.','Faultless sequitur.':'Wolfe responding to Mr. Townsend's explanation that a (golf club) brassie gets its name by virtue of its brass bottom.','You know, Mr. Townsend, it is our good fortune that the exigencies of birth and training furnish all of us with opportunities for snobbery. My ignorance of this special nomenclature (golf club semantics) provided yours; your innocence of the elementary mental processes provides mine.':'Townsend's instruction was essential for Wolfe to understand how Peter Barstow was murdered.','Must I again remind you, Archie, of the reaction you would have got if you had asked Velasquez to explain why Aesop's hand was resting inside his robe instead of hanging by his side? Must I again demonstrate that while it is permissible to request the scientist to lead you back over his footprints, a similar request of the artist is nonsense, since he, like the lark or the eagle, has made none? Do you need to be told again that I am an artist?':'Wolfe expressing frustration at Archie's request to know how he knew that Barstow was murdered by a poisoned needle shot from a golf club.','You must pardon me; for engineering reasons I arise only for emergencies.':'Wolfe explains to Sarah Barstow why he did not get up when she entered the office and introduced herself.','Sarah Barstow (in reference to Wolfe's orchids): They are too much beauty. Wolfe: At first, yes. But a long intimacy frees you of that illusion, and it also acquaints you with their scantiness of character. ..There is not such a thing as too much beauty. Sarah: Perhaps. Yes, perhaps.':'Exchange between Sarah Barstow and Wolfe after Archie gave her a tour of the plant rooms (while Wolfe investigated the Barstow family finances).','People often find it difficult to think in my presence, I do not leave enough space.':'Wolfe observing Sarah Barstow's discomfort and confusion, encourages her to leave, consider his offer, and reply the next day.','Why taunt me? Why upbraid me? I am merely a genius, not a god.':'Wolfe pushing back against Archie's needling him regarding how he's running the investigation.','There is death in this room.':'Wolfe being dramatic, letting Archie know that he suspects Manuel Kimball has left a trap somewhere in office.','Intrepid.':'Wolfe reacts to Archie's insistence the he personally have Anderson's check certified (despite the rain falling).','Nonsense...what good is an obscenity trial except to popularize literature.':'Wolfe rebutting Archie's assertion that Paul Chapin's book (the focus of an obscenity trial) would not be obtainable due to the court's suppression of it.','To be broke is not a disgrace, merely a catastrophe.':'Wolfe explaining to Farrell why he is willing to hire him. You are broke, but you have a fairly intelligent face.','It is astonishing, the effect a little literary and financial success will produce on a spiritual ailment.':'Wolfe observes Paul Chapin's change in demeanor in the office as Wolfe refuses to give back Chapin's box of personal items.','Ah! Archie. After what Mrs. Chapin has told me, I scarcely expected to find you operating an apartment house switchboard. I am much relieved.':'Both Wolfe and Archie discover the other is safe after Dora Chapin drugged Archie and coerced Wolfe to leave the brownstone to save Archie.','You are the most ridiculous murderer I have ever met. I do not know you well enough to be able to say whether it was through vast stupidity or extraordinary insouciance; however, that may be, you planned the most hazardous of all crimes as if you were devising a harmless parlor game.':'Wolfe confronts Bowen in the decisive gathering in the office.','Great hounds and Cerebrus! Don't need to eat! In heaven's name, are you camels, or bears in for the winter?':'Wolfe responds to Clara Fox's statement that she and her friends don't need to eat (at Wolfe's table after his indirect invitation) or might go out for a bite.In Greek mythology, Cerberus, often referred to as the hound of Hades, is a multi-headed dog that guards the gates of the Underworld to prevent the dead from leaving.','...this is Mr. Saul Panzer. I trust him further than might be thought credible.':'Wolfe introduces Saul Panzer to to Hilda Lindquist. Wolfe is arranging for Lindquist to be in seclusion as the police seek to question anyone connected with Harlan Scovil's murder.','You understand, Miss Fox, this is something unprecedented. It has been many years since any woman has slept under this roof. not that I disapprove of them, except when they attempt to function as domestic animals. When they stick to the vocations for which they are best adapted, such as chicanery, sophistry, self-adornment, cajolery, mystification and incubation, they are sometimes splendid creatures.':'Wolfe explains to Clara Fox what an honor it is to be invited to stay in the South Room.','And as for my keeping you in the ignorance of facts, you already interfere so persistently with my mental processes that I am disinclined to furnish you further grounds for speculation...chiefly you lack patience, and my exercise of it infuriates you.':'Wolfe explains to Archie why he keeps certain information from him during the course of a case.','Confound you, Archie. I have you to thank for this acarpous entanglement.':'Wolfe expressing his frustration after learning from Lord Clivers that he already paid his debt to the Rubber Band. Acarpous means fruitless.','Your meddlings have not entitled you to usurp the fatal dignity of Atropos; don't flatter yourself.':'Wolfe attempting to relieve Clara Fox's sense of guilt over the murder of Mike Walsh. Atropos is the Greek goddess of fate and destiny. Atropos could chose the manner of death of mortals.','Let me make a suggestion, Mr. Hombert. Why don't you go home and go to sleep and leave this affair to be handled by Mr. Cramer...and Mr. Skinner. You probably have abilities of some sort, but they are obviously inappropriate to the present emergency.':'Wolfe responding to Hombert's shouting and threat to arrest Wolfe as a material witness.','I can't help that either; do you think I have the Moerae running errands for me?':'Wolfe, during his invitation to Cramer to wrap up the case. Moerae in Greek mythology were the incarnations for destiny, responsible for making sure that all beings lived out their destiny.','Sir, I would not enter a taxicab for a chance to solve the Sphinxs deepest riddles with all the Niles cargo for my reward! Good God. A taxicab...You observe my bulk. I am not immovable, but my flesh has a constitutional reluctance to sudden, violent, or sustained displacement.':'Wolfe responds to Llewellen Frost's effrontery and suggestion that he travel twenty blocks via taxicab to help him solve a problem.','I don't trust you; you are incensed; the flame of fear and resentment is burning in you.':'Wolfe explains to his client, Lew Frost, who wishes to halt the investigation, why he does not trust an uncertified check in payment for his efforts.','Put him out, Archie.':'Wolfe responds to an insulting comment made by Dudley Frost.','I was wrong. Death did stalk him here. I am an imbecile.':'Wolfe rebukes himself after witnessing Boyden McNair dying in the office.','I confess that I have on occasions quibbled with you and played with double meanings, but you have never known me to tell you a direct and categorical lie. Never, sir. I tell you now that I have never seen Mr. McNair's red box, I have no idea where it is or was, and I have no knowledge whatever of its contents.':'Wolfe responding to Insp. Cramer's insinuation that he has possession of McNair's red box.','And you, sir, who engaged me to solve a problem and then proceeded to hamper me aa soon as I made the first step - now you are quick on the trigger to resent it if I do not show tenderness and consideration for your cousin's remorse and grief. I show none because I have none. If I offer anything for sale in this office that is worth buying, it certainly is not a warm heart and maudlin sympathy for the distress of spoiled obtuse children.':'Wolfe chastises Lewellen and Helen Frost after the murder of Boyden McNair and their unannounced appearance at the brownstone.','It is legally mine. Defend it.':'Wolfe's instructions to Saul regarding the red box, if Saul should find it.','Dear me. As cynical as that about it? But a brave cynicism which is of course proper. Nothing is more admirable than the fortitude with which millionaires tolerate the disadvantages of their wealth.':'Wolfe responding to Helen Frost's comment that many men (Gebert among them) have pursued her for her money.','Culture: I have a house in Egypt which I haven't seen for twenty years. It has Rhages and Veramine tiles on the doorway.':'Wolfe tells Helen Frost about his home in Egypt after she mentions living in Egypt as a child. Rhages is both a vintage style of tile and also the name of a beautiful lavender orchid. Veramine is a traditional middle eastern styled pattern used in rugs and tiles.','History: Restaurant? I know nothing of restaurants; short of compulsion, I would not eat in one were Vatel himself the chef.':'Vatel (1631-1671) served French nobility and was known for his meticulous attention to detail in matters concerning the serving of food. He reportedly committed suicide over the delay in the arrival of seafood he was to have served at a banquet.','We're combing a meadow for a mustard seed ... Tell me.':'Wolfe encourages Helen Frost to describe a recurring dream she has about her father.','Culture: Archie observes that Wolfe is re-reading the 'Seven Pillars of Wisdom' in the office. Later, at dinner, Wolfe (approvingly) attributes Lawrence's success in Arabia to his personal attitude toward women being aligned with traditional Arabian attitudes, but he is not specific regarding exactly what that attitude is.':''Seven Pillars of Wisdom' is the autobiographical account of the experiences of British Army Colonel T. E. Lawrence who served as a military advisor to Bedouin forces during the Arab Revolt against the Ottoman Turks from 1916 to 1918. The book was completed in February 1922, but first published in December 1926. The title comes from the King James Bible, Book of Proverbs (9:1): Wisdom hath builded her house, she hath hewn out her seven pillars.','It's discipline. It fortifies me to put up with ordinary inanities for days. I gladly confess that after listening to the Pearls of Wisdom your conversation is an intellectual and esthetic delight. It's the tops.':'Wolfe explains to Archie why he listens to the Pearls of Wisdom Hour on the radio (during which he sits eyes closed with an awful grimace on his face).','Vocabulary: ... my distrust and hatred of vehicles in motion is partly based on my plerophory that their apparent submission to control is illusory...':'Wolfe explains to Archie the cause of their crash. Plerophory means complete assurance.','Sophistry. Casuistry. Ignoratio elenchi.':'Sophistry: the use of fallacious arguments, especially with the intention of deceiving. Casuistry: the use of clever but unsound reasoning, especially in relation to moral questions. Ignoratio elenchi (Latin): a logical fallacy which consists in apparently refuting an opponent while actually disproving something not asserted. Wolfe apparently is trying to console Archie (who feels responsible for Clyde sgoods death on his watch) by informing him that his logic is flawed. The bull did not kill Osgood; thus, Archie could not be responsible for allowing him to do so.','Vocabulary: The only way I can apodictically eliminate anyone from consideration as the possible murderer is to find out who did it.':'Wolfe is explaining to Fred Osgood who shall be under his scrutiny as he investigates the murder. Apodictically means to express something as a certain truth.','Literature: You called Mr. Pratt Monte Cristo?':'During an interview, Caroline Osgood inadvertently refers to Tom Pratt as Monte Cristo, which Wolfe confirms in this quotation to Caroline. In the French novel The Count of Monte Cristo, Monte Cristo is the identity the character Dantès assumes when he emerges from prison and acquires a vast fortune. The Count of Monte Cristo is usually associated with a coldness and bitterness that comes from an existence based solely on revenge. Thus, it seems that the Osgood children ridicule Pratt with this name they consider humorous.','Literature: I am a hired instrument of vengeance ... Nowadays, an Erinys wears a coat and trousers and drinks beer and works for pay, but the function is unaltered and should still be performed, if at all, mercilessly.':'When Nancy Osgood objects to the nature and tone of Wolfes questioning, he explains the nature of his existence and purpose in her household. In Greek mythology and religion, the Erinyes (Erinys is the singular; also, known as the Furies and the Eumenides) were female deities of vengeance who sprang initially from the spilled blood of Uranus.','Literature: Victor Hugo wrote a whole book to prove that a lie can be sublime.':'Wolfe makes this reference to Hugo's Les Miserables in which Jean Valjean lies about his identity after escaping from prison and rebuilding his life.','Vocabulary: ...we can discuss facts calmly, without a lot of useless pother.':'Wolfe bantering with Bronson before getting more direct regarding Clyde Osgood's murder. Pother is a state of nervous activity or fuss.','Vocabulary: Ethology is chaos.':'Wolfe bantering with Bronson prior to substantive questioning. Ethology is the study of animal (in this case human) behavior.','Vocabulary: If I palaver with you at all -':'Wolfe is trying to explain to DA Waddell why his lines of inquiries are flawed. Palaver (v) - to talk unproductively and at length.','Vocabulary: Proscriptions carried too far lead to nullity.':'Wolfe is encouraging Archie to utilize Lily Rowan's fondness for him to their advantage (Archie had indicated that he didn't like to use his spiritual appeal for business purposes. Proscription (n): the action of forbidding something; banning. Nullity (n): something legally void; a thing of no importance or worth.',"
